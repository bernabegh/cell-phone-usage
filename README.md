# Getting Started

This is a Spring Boot based project, so, in order to see the report you can run the project and visit this URL:
http://localhost:8080/usage

# Some details
I parsed the CSV data into java objects to manage the data easily. <br><br>
In order to keep the controller as clean as posible, I created some services to develop all the logic

* Util Service: There are two methods that get the data from each CSV files 
* Report Operations Service: this service performs some operations needed to get the report's information
